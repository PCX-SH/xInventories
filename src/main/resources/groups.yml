# xInventories Group Configuration
#
# Groups define which worlds share inventories.
# Players switching between worlds in the same group keep their inventory.
# Players switching to a world in a different group get that group's inventory.

groups:
  # Survival group - main worlds
  survival:
    # Explicitly assigned worlds
    worlds:
      - "world"
      - "world_nether"
      - "world_the_end"

    # Worlds matching these patterns join this group automatically

  # ============================================================
  # Conditional Group Examples
  # ============================================================
  # Groups can have conditions that determine if a player qualifies.
  # When conditions are defined, the group is only applied if the
  # player meets those conditions (in addition to world matching).

  # Example: VIP players get a different inventory
  # vip_survival:
  #   worlds: []                    # No world restriction
  #   patterns: []
  #   priority: 15                  # Higher than regular survival (10)
  #   conditions:
  #     permission: "xinventories.group.vip"

  # Example: Staff-only creative world
  # staff_creative:
  #   worlds:
  #     - "creative"
  #   priority: 25                  # Higher than regular creative
  #   conditions:
  #     permission: "xinventories.group.staff"

  # Example: Event inventory (time-based)
  # event_halloween:
  #   worlds:
  #     - "*"                       # All worlds
  #   priority: 100
  #   conditions:
  #     schedule:
  #       - start: "2024-10-25T00:00:00"
  #         end: "2024-11-01T23:59:59"
  #         timezone: "America/New_York"
  #     # OR use cron expression:
  #     # cron: "0 18-22 * * FRI,SAT"   # Fridays and Saturdays 6-10 PM

  # Example: High-level player inventory (PlaceholderAPI required)
  # veteran_survival:
  #   worlds: []
  #   priority: 12
  #   conditions:
  #     placeholder:
  #       placeholder: "%player_level%"
  #       operator: ">="
  #       value: "50"
  #     # Multiple conditions (require-all determines AND vs OR):
  #     # placeholders:
  #     #   - placeholder: "%player_level%"
  #     #     operator: ">="
  #     #     value: "50"
  #     #   - placeholder: "%player_playtime_hours%"
  #     #     operator: ">="
  #     #     value: "100"
  #     require-all: true           # AND logic (all conditions must match)

# Default group for unassigned worlds
default-group: survival

# Global settings applied to all groups (can be overridden per-group)
global-settings:
  # Notify players when inventory switches
  notify-on-switch: true
  # Sound to play on switch (null for none)
  switch-sound: "ENTITY_ENDERMAN_TELEPORT"
  switch-sound-volume: 0.5
  switch-sound-pitch: 1.2
